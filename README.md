Project1-CS3366(Human Computer Interaction) - Fall 2022

Project Description:
The purpose of this project is to give you some practice with the material in the design of everyday things.
We use elevators everyday. They have various designs for user controls but not all of them are designed at the best for users. Here are some examples: Analyzing elevator controls using Nielsen-Norman's Usability Heuristics

***To get a C, you need to:***

Find an elevator in the apartment/hotel/airport. Only one example for each student.
Location: Texas Tech IMSE BUILDING 

Take photos of the control interface, Show a gif image of the control interface in operation: 

Find the issues with the current design.Explain why it is good/bad

The current design is good because:
- It provides User Feedback for every input with Lights, a Display screen as well as chime and alarm sounds.
- All buttons are labeled with either symbols alone or both symbols and text labels e.g. Open and close door buttons are labelled so they are not to be confused.

The current design is bad because:
- LED Display screen is really high, it could cause neck strain for user standing in front or short users.  
- Although there are potruding brailee codes beside buttons for visually impared users, braille and labelling could be confused because of spacing.







***To get a B, you need to:***

Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. 

Does the interface make doing those common things easier?

Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?

How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?

How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?

What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?

Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.



Now, imagine that you can have a touch screen on the elevator. To get a A, you need to:

Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?
Design and implement interactive features
Design and implement user feedback



You can get extra credits if:

Your design supports people with disabilities
You provide extra useful information on the display interface.
Your imagination ...
